## Abstract
**Objective**. Traditional methods of analyzing the structure of psychological strengths with the VIA Inventory of Strengths (VIA-IS) have yielded different solutions, not always confirming the original structure of 24 strengths corresponding to six virtues as proposed by Peterson and Seligman (2004).
**Method**. In contrast with previous studies that have analyzed psychological strengths using latent variable approaches, this study used network analyses to explore the map of strengths in a large sample of individuals (N = 1,255,248) from the general population in the United States, Australia, Canada, and UK.
**Results**. The network analysis revealed four different communities (i.e., groups of strengths): Discernment, Interpersonal, Responsibility, and Energy. The strength most connected to other nodes was Gratitude, whereas Love of Learning was the least connected node. The overall network predictability was quite high (mean R2 = .49), and the stability of the network was adequate.
**Conclusion**. These results open a new way to conceptualize psychological strengths as a complex network of mutually interconnected elements. Furthermore, it reveals a structure of four distinct groups of strengths that complement results from factor analyses that future research should replicate and validate.
